Age Gate Builder
Thanks for your interest in joining the Wyng Professional Services team. As a way to help us get to know you and your code a little better, we would like to have you build
an age gate landing page plugin that meets the following criteria:
  Month / Year Birthday Selector Success / Fail Message
  If user is 21 or older, show “welcome” success message.
  If user is under the age of 21, show an error message.
  A “remember me” check box that allows a successful user to return to the page and bypass the age gate.
Bonus:
  Upgrade the selector to include Monday / Day / Year.
  Build this plugin to allow the code to be adjusted to easily account for any age requirement.
  You have creative freedom when it comes to the design of your age gate.
